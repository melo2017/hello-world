# hello-world

My name is Walter, i'm brazilian from SÃ£o Paulo, 23 years old
Well i'm a programmer in training ... i started at RPG Maker in Ruby
recently i was learning Ruby, Rails, Sinatra etc and i ve learned a little about programming
Vagrant, Docker.. at the moment i'm training more C++ and Javacript

my worst problem is because i'm very shy about the things i made by myself ... never had the guts
to make a blog, or something... my intention here is to win this limitation .. i'll try to post here everything i will make .. even if it's a simple "Hello World" or a calculator
